## how to use it?

the way you use it is by downloading it as a zip file then extracting it.

you go into the command prompt of it and that folder and do python shell.py or go into vscode and do the same thign in the termminal of course in that folder or you can make another file anywhere and do RUN("filename.fileextension") (and put in the code there) of course fills those out with your information but before doing tht you would have to run python shell.py the same way before
